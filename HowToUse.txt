so here is the tldr version on how to use the environment

the javascript files are in the app folder, index.js is our entry point, 
and it shares the folder with index.html

other components should be written in the components folder in the app folder
don't move index.js and index.html otherwise it will break.

make sure to have nodejs installed


==============FOR THE FIRST TIME====================================
Make sure you don't have a node_modules folder in the root directory. 
I thought y'all needed it so I committed and pushed it, but its the wrong
way to do things.

The very first time you want to start coding, you need to navigate to 
your root directory in terminal and run the command "npm install"

=====================================================================

After npm is installed, you can navigate to your root directory in 
terminal and run the command "npm run build" to compile your code

you can also run "npm run start"
this will compile and start a local server over at http://localhost:8080
so you can have live updates
