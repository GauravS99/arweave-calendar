# Arweave Calendar
# About
Arweave Calendar is an online calendar that uses the Arweave network and your keyfile to back up each calendar event added to the Arweave, the permanant web. Adding items to do the To Do list updates the calendar with the item. It uses local storage to save calendar events as well, so no registration required!
# Usage
To enable backing up on the Arweave, navigate to settings and choose your Arweave keyfile from your computer. With this keyfile loaded, any To Do items will be backed up to the Arweave using AR (Arweave's cryptocurrency) from your wallet. Make sure you have enough AR for the transansaction or it will be unsuccessful. 

To find your data in the Arweave, click on a To Do list item and you will be prompted with the transaction ID of the item. Follow the guide at https://docs.arweave.org/developers/server/http-api to use this to find the transaction.
